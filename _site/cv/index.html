    <h1 id="intro">Intro:</h1>
<p>Fresh of the new millenium, born in the 2000, I have always had a <em>curious</em> approch on things, and that’s where both my path in the academic career and artistic career started.</p>

<h1 id="professional-profile">Professional profile:</h1>
<p>I have attended a scientific high school, that helped me a lot to expand my knowledge, giving me a great basis of mathematics, physics, history and Latin. During this 5 year long journey I’ve also learnt to face the audience, to communicate with people, to team up in groups to solve problems and complete a variety of school projects.</p>

<p>With the help of the 200-hour work-school project by the government (alternanza scuola-lavoro), I had the chance to follow economy lessons, visit cultural sites and start to work in a real working environment.</p>

<p>I worked for three weeks, full day shifts, in the headquarter of the Italian company <a href="https://www.mbe.it/en">MBE</a> (Mail Boxes Etcetera), mainly focused on selling services such as expeditions or prints. I was assigned to the IT department to learn the computer system that the company uses to handle all MBE; I have also helped the company to remove encrypted and non-usable files through a program that I developed with Powershell, against the crypto-virus. This experience made me realize how important it is to work in a well-integrated team where everyone plays a distinctive role; I have also well understood how MBE company is structured and every aspect of it.</p>

<p>Along with this work experience, I did two security courses, a general one, and a specific one on the risk of using technology on a daily basis for a long time.</p>

<p>I am currently at the third year (2022/2023) of university, studying Computer Science for New Media Communications at University Statale of Milan. Along with the university, I worked part-time one year at <a href="https://www.mbe.it/en">MBE</a> company as an IT Assistant and my main task was about programming for processes automation and data entry, along with web development.</p>

<h1 id="artistic-profile">Artistic profile:</h1>
<p>Within school, I have always tried and done various sports, and the one that has always given me plenty of satisfaction is is juggling.</p>

<p>I have started my formation in circus arts at the age of 7 till I was 12 years old, doing a theatre course, that gave me the basis of face and body expression.</p>

<p>Later I have started to have an interest in juggling, so I thought myself some basics, such as the 3 balls cascade and some variations. Later on, for about 5 years, I went to the PSC, Piccola Scuola di Circo di Milano (One of the mainly known preparatory circus school in Italy) where I did acrobatics (on the floor and with the trampoline), air stuff (rope, trapeze, silks), acrobalance and juggling; I learnt juggling techniques and acrobatics such as rolls, handstand, frontflip on the floor, sideflip, frontflip with half spin at the trampoline. Realizing at a certain moment that my teacher could not teach me any further juggling techniques but could still provide me with lots of ideas to develop, I kept doing an acrobatic course as well as  juggling indoor for two years.</p>

<p>After an amazing workshop with the Japanese juggler Hisashi Watanabe, I have started to practice more and more the improvising technique, using both body, music and props. With this technique, I was involved for the main event of  a new opera of the Theatre La Scala, where we simulated a French court of the late ‘700, with noblemen, singers and artists. Viewers could walk through this wrapping scenario watching live all the performances as an interactive art exhibition.</p>

<p>As I discovered the deep connection between music and juggling, two years ago I’ve started learning the Harmonic Throws Notation developed by Jonathan Lardillier, by doing a full week training in the 2018 EJC with Vincent Mangaud, and then reading and writing routines based on music. The summer of 2019 I’ve done a 10 days residency in France with Jonathan Lardillier and Vincent Mangaud, every day I helped them performing a show and we worked to explore many concepts of the notation, particularly the music concept of the canon applied on juggling with the help of the HTN.</p>

<p>Nowadays I’m focusing both on learning music theory and trying to applying some rules to the juggling world.</p>
