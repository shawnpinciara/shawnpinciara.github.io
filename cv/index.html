            <h1 class="h1_title" id="interests">Interests:</h1>
                        <p>I have interests in arts and poetry, from Romanticism to
                        Impressionism, music (70’/80’ rock) and digital arts as
                        photography and videomaking. I did some
                        juggling/videomaking projects that can be found on my youtube channel.
                        Recently in a teenager recreational centre, on a volunteer basis, I have
                        been helping young musicians to arrange musical pieces and record
                        voices/instruments. I also play a little bit the guitar myself. I am
                        always researching new things in the shape of art, to inspire and be
                        inspired (I am always in search for new artistic challenges/clues to
                        inspire and get inspiration from). One thing that inspires me the most
                        is nature; I have gone (done) hiking and climbing for almost 10 years
                        now, and every time I get excited when I discover a new path or get
                        stunned by the view. I think that plunging into nature is not only a way
                        to do sport and outdoor activity, but nature itself gives me sometimes
                        the power and energy to get through things, and helps me a lot to find
                        my inner peace. That’s why, when there is the chance, I always try to
                        spend time outside to keep my body and mind in a healthy
                        condition.</p>
