                        <p>I have attended a 
                            <a href="">scientific high school,</a>
                            giving me a good basis of mathematics, physics, 
                            history and Latin. Despite not formally studying programming in school i tought 
                            myself so and started to manage simple projects such as the school's website.
                            <br><br>
                            With the help of the 200-hour work-school project by the government (alternanza scuola-lavoro in 2017), 
                            I worked for one months, full day shifts, in the headquarter of the Italian company <a href="https://www.mbe.it/en">MBE</a>
                            (Mail Boxes Etcetera), mainly focused on selling services such as expeditions or prints. I have also helped the
                             company to remove encrypted and non-usable files through scripts I developed with Powershell, against the crypto-virus. 
                             <br><br>
                            Two years later (2019) led me to having 
                            <a href="">a one year contract (2019) with MBE as an IT Assistant</a>
                            , where I was put to do data entry, 
                            bridging datas manually through different platforms.
                            I than started (out of personal desire basically) to automate these processes using Python and APIs to automatically take datas form servers and dbs, 
                            rearrange and correct them, and send them back to the other platforms. 
                            Through this experience I learnt how much I love to make processes much more efficient.
                            <br><br>
                            <a href="">As of April 2024 I got the degree in Computer Science for New Media Communications at University Statale of Milan</a>
                            , writing a thesis about 
                            “A multi-touch control surface implemented as a MIDI controller” , where despite graduating in New Media Communication, 
                            I wanted to make a formal bridge with a passion of mine (music) by writing a thesis in collaborazion with the 
                            <a href="https://www.lim.di.unimi.it/index.php?lang=eng">LIM</a> (Milano Statal University’s *Music Informatics Laboratory)*
                            <br><br>
                    
                            <a href="">Communication wise</a> I handled the communication (As an Istagram social media manager and content creator) of:

            <h1 class="h1_title" id="artistic-profile">Artistic profile:</h1>
                        <p>Within school, I have always tried and done various sports, and the
                        one that has always given me plenty of satisfaction is is juggling.</p>
                        <p>I have started my formation in circus arts at the age of 7 till I was
                        12 years old, doing a theatre course, that gave me the basis of face and
                        body expression.</p>
                        <p>Later I have started to have an interest in juggling, so I thought
                        myself some basics, such as the 3 balls cascade and some variations.
                        Later on, for about 5 years, I went to the PSC, Piccola Scuola di Circo
                        di Milano (One of the mainly known preparatory circus school in Italy)
                        where I did acrobatics (on the floor and with the trampoline), air stuff
                        (rope, trapeze, silks), acrobalance and juggling; I learnt juggling
                        techniques and acrobatics such as rolls, handstand, frontflip on the
                        floor, sideflip, frontflip with half spin at the trampoline. Realizing
                        at a certain moment that my teacher could not teach me any further
                        juggling techniques but could still provide me with lots of ideas to
                        develop, I kept doing an acrobatic course as well as juggling indoor for
                        two years.</p>
                        <p>After an amazing workshop with the Japanese juggler Hisashi Watanabe,
                        I have started to practice more and more the improvising technique,
                        using both body, music and props. With this technique, I was involved
                        for the main event of a new opera of the Theatre La Scala, where we
                        simulated a French court of the late ’700, with noblemen, singers and
                        artists. Viewers could walk through this wrapping scenario watching live
                        all the performances as an interactive art exhibition.</p>
                        <p>As I discovered the deep connection between music and juggling, in
                        2018 I’ve started learning the Harmonic Throws Notation developed by
                        Jonathan Lardillier. The summer of 2019 I’ve done a 10 days residency in
                        France with Jonathan Lardillier and Vincent Mangaud, helping them
                        performing a show and we worked to explore many concepts of the
                        notation, particularly the music concept of the canon applied on
                        juggling with the help of the HTN.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays I’m focusing both on learning music theory and trying to
                        applying some rules to the juggling world.</p>

            <h1 class="h1_title" id="interests">Interests:</h1>
                        <p>I have interests in arts and poetry, from Romanticism to
                        Impressionism, music (70’/80’ rock) and digital arts as
                        photography and videomaking. I did some
                        juggling/videomaking projects that can be found on my youtube channel.
                        Recently in a teenager recreational centre, on a volunteer basis, I have
                        been helping young musicians to arrange musical pieces and record
                        voices/instruments. I also play a little bit the guitar myself. I am
                        always researching new things in the shape of art, to inspire and be
                        inspired (I am always in search for new artistic challenges/clues to
                        inspire and get inspiration from). One thing that inspires me the most
                        is nature; I have gone (done) hiking and climbing for almost 10 years
                        now, and every time I get excited when I discover a new path or get
                        stunned by the view. I think that plunging into nature is not only a way
                        to do sport and outdoor activity, but nature itself gives me sometimes
                        the power and energy to get through things, and helps me a lot to find
                        my inner peace. That’s why, when there is the chance, I always try to
                        spend time outside to keep my body and mind in a healthy
                        condition.</p>
