                        <h1 id="intro">Intro:</h1>
                        <p>Fresh of the new millenium, born in the 2000, I have always had a
                        <em>curious</em> approch on things, and that’s where both my path in the
                        academic career and artistic career started.</p>
                        <h1 id="professional-profile">Professional profile:</h1>
                        <p>I have attended a scientific high school, that helped me a lot to
                        expand my knowledge, giving me a great basis of mathematics, physics,
                        history and Latin. During this 5 year long journey I’ve also learnt to
                        face the audience, to communicate with people, to team up in groups to
                        solve problems and complete a variety of school projects.</p>
                        <p>With the help of the 200-hour work-school project by the government
                        (alternanza scuola-lavoro), I worked (more like volunteered) for a month, full day shifts,
                        in the headquarter of the Italian company <a
                        href="https://www.mbe.it/en">MBE</a> (Mail Boxes Etcetera), mainly
                        focused on selling services such as expeditions or prints. I have also
                        helped the company to remove encrypted and non-usable files through a
                        program developed with Powershell, against the crypto-virus. This
                        experience made me realize how important it is to work in a
                        well-integrated team where everyone plays a distinctive role.</p>
                        <p>I am currently at the final period of a bachelor degree in Computer
                        Science for New Media Communications at University Statale of Milan, writing my thesis about a peculiar surface based MIDI controller.
                        Along with university, I worked one year at <a
                        href="https://www.mbe.it/en">MBE</a> company as an IT Assistant and my
                        main task was processes automation and data entry, along with web
                        development. Soon enough i got tired of manually moving datas between platforms, so i developed
                        different scripts (Python) to retrieve data from a service (with rest APIs and web-scraping), formatting them well and 
                        pushing them onto another platform; all done automathically with a bunch of clicks. <br>
                        The key points learnt from this experience are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The error in the human: humans based error should be accounted during processes.</li>
                                <li>Efficiency: I fell in love with using technologies to rise the level of efficiency and precision of processes.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Communication wise I handled the communication (As an Istagram social media manager and content creator) of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>PlayJuggling: (for 4 years) leader in the field of gymnastic/circus equipment.</li>
                            <li>YoungDoIt: (for 1 years) the youth center in the city of Arese.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From 2021 I've been very active in the volunteering field of the youth center of Arese and the city itself, helping to organize cultural events, concerts, talks.

                        <h1 id="artistic-profile">Artistic profile:</h1>
                        <p>Within school, I have always tried and done various sports, and the
                        one that has always given me plenty of satisfaction is is juggling.</p>
                        <p>I have started my formation in circus arts at the age of 7 till I was
                        12 years old, doing a theatre course, that gave me the basis of face and
                        body expression.</p>
                        <p>Later I have started to have an interest in juggling, so I thought
                        myself some basics, such as the 3 balls cascade and some variations.
                        Later on, for about 5 years, I went to the PSC, Piccola Scuola di Circo
                        di Milano (One of the mainly known preparatory circus school in Italy)
                        where I did acrobatics (on the floor and with the trampoline), air stuff
                        (rope, trapeze, silks), acrobalance and juggling; I learnt juggling
                        techniques and acrobatics such as rolls, handstand, frontflip on the
                        floor, sideflip, frontflip with half spin at the trampoline. Realizing
                        at a certain moment that my teacher could not teach me any further
                        juggling techniques but could still provide me with lots of ideas to
                        develop, I kept doing an acrobatic course as well as juggling indoor for
                        two years.</p>
                        <p>After an amazing workshop with the Japanese juggler Hisashi Watanabe,
                        I have started to practice more and more the improvising technique,
                        using both body, music and props. With this technique, I was involved
                        for the main event of a new opera of the Theatre La Scala, where we
                        simulated a French court of the late ’700, with noblemen, singers and
                        artists. Viewers could walk through this wrapping scenario watching live
                        all the performances as an interactive art exhibition.</p>
                        <p>As I discovered the deep connection between music and juggling, in
                        2018 I’ve started learning the Harmonic Throws Notation developed by
                        Jonathan Lardillier. The summer of 2019 I’ve done a 10 days residency in
                        France with Jonathan Lardillier and Vincent Mangaud, helping them
                        performing a show and we worked to explore many concepts of the
                        notation, particularly the music concept of the canon applied on
                        juggling with the help of the HTN.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays I’m focusing both on learning music theory and trying to
                        applying some rules to the juggling world.</p>
                        <h1 id="interests">Interests:</h1>
                        <p>I have interests in arts and poetry, from Romanticism to
                        Impressionism, music (70’/80’ rock) and digital arts as
                        photography and videomaking. I did some
                        juggling/videomaking projects that can be found on my youtube channel.
                        Recently in a teenager recreational centre, on a volunteer basis, I have
                        been helping young musicians to arrange musical pieces and record
                        voices/instruments. I also play a little bit the guitar myself. I am
                        always researching new things in the shape of art, to inspire and be
                        inspired (I am always in search for new artistic challenges/clues to
                        inspire and get inspiration from). One thing that inspires me the most
                        is nature; I have gone (done) hiking and climbing for almost 10 years
                        now, and every time I get excited when I discover a new path or get
                        stunned by the view. I think that plunging into nature is not only a way
                        to do sport and outdoor activity, but nature itself gives me sometimes
                        the power and energy to get through things, and helps me a lot to find
                        my inner peace. That’s why, when there is the chance, I always try to
                        spend time outside to keep my body and mind in a healthy
                        condition.</p>
