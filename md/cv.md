# Intro:
Fresh of the new millenium, born in the 2000, I have always had a _curious_ approch on things, and that’s where both my path in the academic career and artistic career started.

# Professional profile:
I have attended a scientific high school, that helped me a lot to expand my knowledge, giving me a great basis of mathematics, physics, history and Latin. During this 5 year long journey I’ve also learnt to face the audience, to communicate with people, to team up in groups to solve problems and complete a variety of school projects. 

With the help of the 200-hour work-school project by the government (alternanza scuola-lavoro), I worked for three weeks, full day shifts, in the headquarter of the Italian company [MBE](https://www.mbe.it/en) (Mail Boxes Etcetera), mainly focused on selling services such as expeditions or prints. I have also helped the company to remove encrypted and non-usable files through a program that I developed with Powershell, against the crypto-virus. This experience made me realize how important it is to work in a well-integrated team where everyone plays a distinctive role; I have also well understood how MBE company is structured and every aspect of it.

I am currently at the final period of a bachelor degree in Computer Science for New Media Communications at University Statale of Milan. Along with university, I worked part-time one year at [MBE](https://www.mbe.it/en) company as an IT Assistant and my main task was processes automation and data entry, along with web development.

# Artistic profile:
Within school, I have always tried and done various sports, and the one that has always given me plenty of satisfaction is is juggling.

I have started my formation in circus arts at the age of 7 till I was 12 years old, doing a theatre course, that gave me the basis of face and body expression.

 Later I have started to have an interest in juggling, so I thought myself some basics, such as the 3 balls cascade and some variations. Later on, for about 5 years, I went to the PSC, Piccola Scuola di Circo di Milano (One of the mainly known preparatory circus school in Italy) where I did acrobatics (on the floor and with the trampoline), air stuff (rope, trapeze, silks), acrobalance and juggling; I learnt juggling techniques and acrobatics such as rolls, handstand, frontflip on the floor, sideflip, frontflip with half spin at the trampoline. Realizing at a certain moment that my teacher could not teach me any further juggling techniques but could still provide me with lots of ideas to develop, I kept doing an acrobatic course as well as  juggling indoor for two years.

After an amazing workshop with the Japanese juggler Hisashi Watanabe, I have started to practice more and more the improvising technique, using both body, music and props. With this technique, I was involved for the main event of  a new opera of the Theatre La Scala, where we simulated a French court of the late ‘700, with noblemen, singers and artists. Viewers could walk through this wrapping scenario watching live all the performances as an interactive art exhibition. 

As I discovered the deep connection between music and juggling, in 2018 I’ve started learning the Harmonic Throws Notation developed by Jonathan Lardillier. The summer of 2019 I’ve done a 10 days residency in France with Jonathan Lardillier and Vincent Mangaud, helping them performing a show and we worked to explore many concepts of the notation, particularly the music concept of the canon applied on juggling with the help of the HTN.

Nowadays I’m focusing both on learning music theory and trying to applying some rules to the juggling world. 

# Interests:
I have interests in arts and poetry, from Romanticism to Impressionism, music (70’/80’ rock is my favourite) and digital arts as photography, videomaking and illustrations. I did some juggling/videomaking projects that can be found on my youtube channel. Recently in a teenager recreational centre, on a volunteer basis, I have been helping young musicians to arrange musical pieces and record voices/instruments. I also play a little bit the guitar myself. I am always researching new things in the shape of art, to inspire and be inspired (I am always in search for new artistic challenges/clues to inspire and get inspiration from). 
One thing that inspires me the most is nature; I have gone (done) hiking and climbing for almost 10 years now, and every time I get excited when I discover a new path or get stunned by the view. I think that plunging into nature is not only a way to do sport and outdoor activity, but nature itself gives me sometimes the power and energy to get through things, and helps me a lot to find my inner peace. That's why, when there is the chance, I always try to spend time outside to keep my body and mind in a healthy condition.
